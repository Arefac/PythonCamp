<h1>Python and data science</h1>
In this training camp, the intention is to teach participants various topics in Python and data science. These two areas are among the most popular and important subjects in the field of information technology, and acquiring knowledge in these areas can expand job opportunities and professional development.

During the course, the goal is to teach students the essential concepts in Python and data science. The focus areas can include:
<ul>
    <li>
Introduction to Python: Basic concepts, Python installation, and development environments such as Anaconda or PyCharm.
</li>
    <li>Control structures: Variable declaration, conditionals (if-else), loops (such as for and while), functions, and lambda functions.
</li>
    <li>Data structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.
</li>
    <li>Operators and arithmetic operations: Mathematical operations, logical operators, and string operations.
</li>
    <li>Files and input/output: Reading from and writing to files, working with console input and output.
</li>
    <li>Errors and exceptions: Handling and checking errors in programs.
</li>

</ul>





In the field of data science, the focus areas can include:
